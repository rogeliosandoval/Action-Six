This application has 5 JavaScript games the user can play when boredom hits. A call to a "bored" API is also proivded to give the user ideas on what else they can do to pass the time. Controls and rules are provided with each game.
<br>
<br>
Creating this application allowed me to practice manipulating DOM elements through the Angular framework as well as to brush up on some programming skills. A great refresher on the basic fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML, taking them to a greater height.

Photoshop was used to create the game cards along with all of the sprites. The logo is custom made as well using an online generator called <a href="https://cooltext.com/"><b>Cooltext</b></a>, I highly recommend it for use in any of your personal projects.
<br>
<br>
More functionality and updates are planned for the future such as a scoring system, more playable sprites, etc.. but overall this project was a lot of fun to make!
